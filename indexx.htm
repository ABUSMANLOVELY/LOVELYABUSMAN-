<font face="chiller" size="4" color="black"> <center><h5>DESCRIPTION: A stand-alone Senior High School (SHS) is a secondary school that 
    operates independently from a Junior High School (JHS) or Integrated School (IS). 
    It has its own distinct location and a separate school head (principal). This contrasts with Integrated SHS,
    which is located within an existing JHS or IS and shares the same school head.</center>
